# List of Files:


- Models_Output: Folder containing results from GAPIT for each model and kinship matrix. The code to produce this is located in 02.Codes/GAPIT PH.rmd

- Associated_SNPs.xlsx: List of significant SNP markers identified with SUPER + IBDLD, SUPER + G, and FarmCPU (both Kinships).

- FarmCPU_Manhattan_Color.png: Image for the manhattan plot for FarmCPU

- Figure A.png: Number of populations computed with A) Structure 2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2003) and B) PCA methods

- Figure B.png: Scatter plot of the discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) for population structure.

- Figure T. Plant Height QQplot.png: QQ plots for each model. Created with QQPlot code in 02.codes

- venn_PH.tiff: Comparison of significant SNPs associated with plant height between SUPER and FarmCPU.
