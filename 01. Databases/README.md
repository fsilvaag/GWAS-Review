# List of files:
- *Blups_487_DH_Lines.csv*: THe blups for plant height for each of the 487 DH lines.

- *GMatrix_VanRaden.csv*: Kinship matrix generated with AGHMatrix package (Amadeu et al. 2016). The matrix was created using the VanRaden                           (2008) methodology.

- *IBDLD_Kinship_Matrix.csv*: Kinship matrix generated from IBD segments using the IBDLD program (Han and Abney 2011, 2013).

- *Plant_Height_Phenotype.xlsx*: Raw phenotypic data

- *Imputed_Genotypic_data*: Genotypic data for the 487 selected DH lines in Hapmap and vcf format. See *Real data* section for details.

- *Numerical012.txt.gz*: The imputed genotypic data coded as 0 (minor allele homozygote), 1 (heterozygote), and 2 (major allele homozygote).

- *README.md*: This file
